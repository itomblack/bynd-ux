# Creativity doesnt just happen...
## Introductory courses in thinking like a designer

Design is at the core of everything we do here at Beyond. The more we can engage with each others work, the greater our work will become.


Ever wondered what goes on in a designers mind?

When everyone shares ideas and knowledge, you open up a world of discovery.


If you believe in the value of collaboration, love the idea of creativy, or simple want to try something new, register your interest for one of our upcoming couses.
